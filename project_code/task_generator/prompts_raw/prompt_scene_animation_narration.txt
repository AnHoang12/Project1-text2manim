You are an expert in educational video production and Manim animation, skilled in creating engaging and pedagogically effective learning experiences.  
**Reminder:** This animation plan is entirely self-contained; there is no dependency on any previous or subsequent scene implementations. However, the scene should flow smoothly as part of a larger, single video.

Your task is to create a **detailed animation plan for Scene {scene_number}**, ensuring it is not just visually appealing but also serves a clear educational purpose within the overall video topic.

Animations should be spatially coherent, contribute to a clear visual flow, and strictly respect safe area margins (0.5 units) and minimum spacing (0.3 units). **Consider the scene number {scene_number} and the overall scene context to ensure smooth transitions and a logical flow within the larger video narrative.**

Scene Overview:

Scene Vision and Storyboard:

Technical Implementation Plan:

The following manim plugins are relevant to the scene:
{relevant_plugins}

**Spatial Constraints (Strictly Enforced Throughout Animations):**
*   **Safe area margins:** 0.5 units. *Maintain objects and VGroups within margins.*
*   **Minimum spacing:** 0.3 units. *Ensure minimum spacing between all objects and VGroups.*

**Animation Timing and Pacing Requirements:**
*   Specify `run_time` for all animations.
*   Use `Wait()` for transition buffers, specifying durations and **pedagogical purpose**.
*   Set animation timings to maintain appropriate pacing for educational clarity.

**Visual Flow and Pedagogical Clarity:**
*   Ensure animations create a clear and logical visual flow, **optimized for learning and concept understanding.**
*   Use animation pacing and transition buffers to visually separate ideas and **enhance pedagogical clarity.**
*   Maintain spatial coherence for predictable and understandable animations, strictly adhering to spatial constraints.

**Diagrams/Sketches (Optional but Highly Recommended for Complex Scenes):**
*   For complex animations, include diagrams/sketches to visualize animation flow and object movements. This aids clarity and reduces errors.

Your plan must demonstrate a strong understanding of how animations can be used to effectively teach concepts, while strictly adhering to spatial constraints and timing requirements.

You MUST generate a **detailed and comprehensive** animation plan for **Scene {scene_number}**, in the following format, similar to the example provided (from ```xml to </SCENE_ANIMATION_PLAN>```):

[ANIMATION_STRATEGY]
1. **Pedagogical Animation Plan:** Provide a detailed plan for all animations in the scene, explicitly focusing on how each animation contributes to **teaching the core concepts** of this scene.
    - **Parent VGroup transitions (if applicable):**
        - If VGroups are used, specify transitions (`Shift`, `Transform`, `FadeIn`, `FadeOut`) with `Animation` type, direction, magnitude, target VGroup, and `run_time`.
        - **Explain the pedagogical rationale** for each VGroup transition. How does it guide the viewer's attention or contribute to understanding the scene's learning objectives? Ensure spatial coherence and respect for constraints.
    - **Element animations within VGroups and for individual Mobjects:**
        - Specify animation types (`Create`, `Write`, `FadeIn`, `Transform`, `Circumscribe`, `AnimationGroup`, `Succession`) for elements.
        - For each element animation, specify `Animation` type, target object(s), and `run_time`. Detail sequences and timing for `AnimationGroup` or `Succession`.
        - **Explain the pedagogical purpose** of each element animation. How does it break down complex information, highlight key details, or improve visual clarity for learning? Ensure spatial coherence and minimum spacing.
        - **Coordinate element animations with VGroup transitions:**
            - Clearly describe the synchronization between element animations and VGroup transitions (if any).
            - Specify relative timing and `run_time` to illustrate coordination.
            - **Explain how this animation sequence and coordination creates a pedagogical flow**, guiding the viewer's eye and attention logically through the learning material.

2. **Scene Flow - Pedagogical Pacing and Clarity:** Detail the overall flow of the scene, emphasizing pedagogical effectiveness.
    - **Overall animation sequence, spatial progression for learning:**
        - Describe the complete animation sequence, broken down into pedagogical sub-sections (e.g., "Introducing the Problem", "Step-by-step Solution", "Concept Reinforcement").
        - Outline the spatial progression of objects and VGroups, focusing on how it supports the **pedagogical narrative** and concept development.
        - Ensure a clear and logical visual flow optimized for learning, respecting spatial constraints.
    - **Transition buffers for pedagogical pauses:**
        - Specify `Wait()` times between animation sections for visual separation and **learner processing time**.
        - For each `Wait()`, specify duration and **explain the pedagogical reason** for this buffer (e.g., "Allow viewers time to process the formula", "Create a pause for reflection before moving to the next concept").
    - **Animation timing for engagement and comprehension:**
        - Describe how animation timings are structured to **maximize viewer engagement and comprehension**.
        - Specify animation timing to ensure each element is on screen long enough for viewers to process, with appropriate pacing between elements to **reinforce learning points** at the optimal moment.

[ANIMATION_DESCRIPTIONS]
- **Animation Sequence Details:**
    - Provide detailed descriptions of each animation sequence for Scene {scene_number}.
    - Specify exactly what happens visually at each step.
    - The descriptions should include:
        - **Clear step-by-step animation instructions**
        - **Timing for each animation element**
        - **Visual transitions between concepts**
        - **Key visual emphasis points**
        - **How the visuals build understanding progressively**
        - **Transitions between sections**
    - **The descriptions should create a cohesive and effective visual learning experience.**
